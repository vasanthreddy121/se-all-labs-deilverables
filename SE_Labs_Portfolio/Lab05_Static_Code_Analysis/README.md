# Lab 5: Static Code Analysis — Online Auction and Bidding System

**Your file:** `auction_system.py`
**Python:** 3.10 or newer

Follow the lab handout for the full instructions.

## About the program

An online auction and bidding system. An `Auction` class tracks reserve prices and closing times; the program accepts bids, picks the winner and final price (with a buyer's premium), lists top bidders, renders HTML listings and bidder badges, and exports bids. `charge_winner()` is an educational simulation only: it returns a simulated status for a sold auction and does not contact a payment gateway or transfer money.

The lab starts from an auction program with quality, style, logic, and security problems of the kind Pylint, Flake8, and Bandit are built to find. The deliverables document the issues, fixes, and verification results.

## What to do

1. **Run it first** and read the output carefully:
   ```bash
   python auction_system.py
   ```
   It runs a short built-in demo and prints the results; it does not ask for input. Read every line and ask whether a sensible program would print that. Not every problem in this file is something a tool will flag, so pay attention to output that looks wrong.

2. **Install the tools:**
   ```bash
   python -m pip install pylint bandit flake8 jinja2
   ```
   `jinja2` is installed as well because the program imports it (its `markupsafe` dependency comes with it); without it the program stops with `ModuleNotFoundError`.

3. **Run the analysis** and save the reports:
   ```bash
   python -m pylint auction_system.py > pylint_report.txt
   python -m bandit -r auction_system.py > bandit_report.txt
   python -m flake8 auction_system.py > flake8_report.txt
   ```
   Use the `python -m` form: it works everywhere, including Windows where a bare `pylint` is often "not recognized". The tools exit with a non-zero status whenever they find issues; that is expected, not an error. In Windows PowerShell 5.1, `>` saves files as UTF-16; if a report looks garbled, use `python -m pylint auction_system.py | Out-File -Encoding utf8 pylint_report.txt` instead.

4. **Document the issues** in `issues.md` using this table (at least 4 rows, high and medium severity first):

   | Issue | Type | Line(s) | Description | Fix Approach |
   |-------|------|---------|-------------|--------------|
   | ... | ... | ... | ... | ... |

5. **Fix the code.** Fix at least 4 of the issues you documented, then rerun all three tools to confirm they are gone. Repeat until you are satisfied. The program should still do its job when you are done.

6. **Reflect.** Answer the four reflection questions from the handout in `reflection.md`.

7. **Run regression tests:**
   ```bash
   python -m unittest -v test_auction_system
   ```
   The tests cover bid acceptance and rejection, reserve-price outcomes, closing-time handling, bidder rankings, empty auctions, HTML escaping, simulated payment safety, and invalid auction IDs.

## Deliverables

1. `auction_system.py`: your cleaned version, with at least 4 issues fixed.
2. `issues.md`: the completed issue table.
3. `reflection.md`: your answers to the reflection questions.

**Target:** aim for a Pylint score above 9.5 on your final file. A perfect 10.00/10 is very good.

Be ready to explain the bugs you found and how you fixed them. You may be called on to present.
